# SKJI--126-
In this version, instead of using division and modulus operation, it uses a nested loop structure to iterate through each denomination. It continuously subtracts the denomination value from the remaining change until it's not possible to use that denomination anymore, incrementing the count each time. Finally, it prints out the result.
